# GameOfBeans_DinamicProgramming

The goal of this project was to build a program in Java that made use dynamic programming techniques (breaking a decision down into a sequence of decision steps through a period of
time). The gist of the game consisted on sequence of piles of beans (where a negative amount of beans was possible to exist) and two players who could remove up to a pre-determined
maximum amount of piles per play, from one of the two ends of the sequence. The two characters involved would present different strategies.

The task was to compute the final score of one of the players, based on the initial sequence of bean piles, game depth and the knowledge of what character was the first to play.

It was developed for the curricular unit of Design and Analysis of Algorithms.
